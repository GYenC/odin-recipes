        <h1>Vegan Mango Cream Cheesecake</h1>
        <img src="cashew.jpg" width="350" alt="actually kinda neat looking">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe originally taken from a vegan recipe book, then alterations were made. This ended up tasting like what I imagine a sweetened suet ball to taste like</p>
        <p>So this ended up not having any mango, cream, cheese, or cake in it. I think it stayed vegan though?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tonnes cashew</li>
            <li>Coconut oil</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Coconut chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash 2/3 the cashew together with some of the coconut oil and sugar</li>
            <li>Mix the rest of the cashew and oil together until slightly more cashewy than before</li>
            <li>Layer cashewy cashew layer on top of the less cashewy cashew-oil mix</li>
            <li>Put in fridge to set</li>
            <li>Sprinkle coconut chips on top</li>
        </ol>
